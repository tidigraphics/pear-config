TODO List for Config
--------------------

- Support comments for directives
  Example:
    myDirective = myValue ; My comment here
  How ? Set comment as child of directive.
  Use the same name for the directive as for the comment (usually,
  they don't have names). Could maybe do the same for sections, then ?
- Recursively remove elements (use getItem ?)
- Container for DB
- Container for .plist
- Unit test everything
- make sure all operations perserve as much as possible (semantically)
